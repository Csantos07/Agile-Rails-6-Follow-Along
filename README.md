# README

## This is a Follow Along For Agile Web Development with Rails 6
I would like to use this as a resource for anyone learning to use rails or
if I ever have to teach Rails again this will be a repo I can leverage.

I also want to hone in my methodology and process. How do I stay organized.
How do I document my progress, dependencies, code, etc.
